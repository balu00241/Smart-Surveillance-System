# Smart Surveillance System

## Introduction
The **Smart Surveillance System** is a cutting-edge, AI-powered solution designed to enhance security through real-time video monitoring. By leveraging Python and computer vision, this project detects motion, tracks objects, and provides customizable alerts for suspicious activities. It is ideal for deployment in homes, offices, or public spaces, offering a robust and efficient method to safeguard your environment.

## Features
- **Real-Time Motion Detection:** Identifies and tracks motion in a live video feed.  
- **Object Tracking:** Draws bounding boxes around detected objects to track their movements.  
- **Customizable Sensitivity:** Adjustable detection thresholds for various environments.  
- **Expandable Architecture:** Designed to integrate with IoT devices for remote monitoring and control.  
- **Future Alert System:** Planned addition of email/SMS notifications for immediate security updates.  

## Why Use This System?
Security systems are crucial in todayâ€™s world, but they can be expensive and difficult to customize. The Smart Surveillance System is:  
1. **Affordable:** A cost-effective alternative to commercial security systems.  
2. **Customizable:** Adapt the code to fit specific needs like adding IoT devices or facial recognition.  
3. **Portable:** Deployable on local machines, Raspberry Pi, or cloud servers.  

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:**  
  - OpenCV: For computer vision operations.  
  - NumPy: For numerical computations.  
  - imutils: For image processing utilities.  

- **Optional Hardware:**  
  - Raspberry Pi: For compact, standalone deployment.  
  - Camera Module: USB or Pi-compatible cameras for capturing video.  

## Prerequisites
Before running the project, ensure the following are installed on your system:  
1. Python 3.7 or higher.  
2. Pip (Python's package manager).  
3. Git (to clone the repository).  

## Installation Guide

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/username/SmartSurveillanceSystem.git
cd SmartSurveillanceSystem
```

### Step 2: Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate    # On Windows: .\venv\Scripts\activate
```

### Step 3: Install Required Python Packages
```bash
pip install opencv-python numpy imutils
```

### Step 4: Connect your Camera
- Plug in your USB camera or make sure your Raspberry Pi Camera Module is enabled.

## Usage

Run the main surveillance script:

```bash
python surveillance.py
```

- The system will start capturing video and detecting motion in real-time.
- Adjust sensitivity in the config file or within the script if needed.

## Configuration

You may want to tweak parameters such as:

- Motion detection sensitivity threshold  
- Frame size or resolution  
- Notification preferences (coming soon)

Check inside the main script or a configuration file (e.g., `config.py`) for these settings.

## Future Plans
- Add email and SMS notification alerts for detected motion.  
- Integrate AI-driven facial recognition for authorized personnel.  
- Build a web dashboard for remote monitoring via IoT.
